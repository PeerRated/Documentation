# Dos & Don'ts

This page shows **specific behaviors** to follow (Do) and avoid (Don't), with short examples.  
Read alongside [Coding](/standards/coding)

## Principles 

### DRY — Don’t Repeat Yourself

![DRY Meme](/images/memes/dry-meme.jpg)

**Do**
- Extract shared logic into a function/module when you see duplication.
- Centralize constants and config.

**Don’t**
- Copy/paste logic in multiple places with slight variations.

```ts
// Don't — duplicated price calc in two places
function calcTotalA(items) { return items.reduce((s, i) => s + i.price * i.qty, 0); }
function calcTotalB(items) { return items.reduce((s, i) => s + i.price * i.qty, 0); }

// Do — one reusable function
export function calcTotal(items: { price: number; qty: number }[]) {
  return items.reduce((sum, it) => sum + it.price * it.qty, 0);
}
```

### KISS — Keep It Simple

![KISS Meme](/images/memes/kiss-meme.png)

**Do**
- Prefer straightforward solutions and plain data structures.
- Ensure readability for future developers (average developer shouldn't have to google/look things up to understand).

**Don’t**
- Over-engineer abstractions or use clever one-liners that hurt readability.

```ts
// Don't — overly clever
const flat = arr => [].concat(...arr.map(x => (Array.isArray(x) ? flat(x) : x)));

// Do — readable and good enough for our needs
export function flatten<T>(arr: (T | T[])[]): T[] {
  const out: T[] = [];
  for (const v of arr) Array.isArray(v) ? out.push(...v) : out.push(v);
  return out;
}
```

### YAGNI — You Aren’t Gonna Need It

![YAGNI Meme](/images/memes/yagni-meme.png)

**Do**
- Build only what the current use case requires.

**Don't**
- Add flags/features “just in case.” (might lead to dead/commented/unused code that adds to compile time)

```ts
// Don't — premature config that's unused
type EmailOpts = { html?: string; text?: string; priority?: 'low'|'high'; retry?: number };
function sendEmail(to: string, opts: EmailOpts) { /* ... */ }

// Do — minimal, fits current usage
type EmailOpts = { html?: string; text?: string };
function sendEmail(to: string, opts: EmailOpts) { /* ... */ }
```

### Single Responsibility

![Single Responsibility](/images/memes/srp-meme.png)

**Do**
- Keep functions/modules focused on one purpose.

**Don’t**
- Mix validation, business logic, persistence, and notifications in one place.

```ts
// Don't — one function does everything
async function registerUser(form: any) {
  if (!form.email) throw new Error('email required');
  const user = await db.users.create(form);
  await emailWelcome(user.email);
  return user;
}

// Do — split responsibilities (some of these should even be in their own files, like user.dao.ts for database calls)
function validateUserInput(form: any) { if (!form.email) throw new Error('email required'); }
async function createUser(data: any) { return db.users.create(data); }
async function notifyWelcome(email: string) { await emailWelcome(email); }

export async function registerUser(form: any) {
  validateUserInput(form);
  const user = await createUser(form);
  await notifyWelcome(user.email);
  return user;
}
```

### Clean Code (Readability)

![Clean Code Meme](/images/memes/cleancode-meme.jpg)

**Dos**
- Favor clear names and early returns

**Don't**
- Nest deeply and use vague names

```ts 
// Don't
function p(u, a) {
  if (u) {
    if (a) {
      // ...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }
}

// Do
function processUser(userId: string, isAdmin: boolean) {
  if (!userId) return;
  if (isAdmin) { /* ... */ return; }
  /* ... */
}
```

### Collective Code Ownership & the “Boy Scout” Rule

![Boy Scout Rule](/images/memes/boyscoutrule.png)

> Leave the code a little better than you found it. This originated from teaching young groups that when you go camping in the outdoors/forests, you should always leave your campsite better than you found it. If you walk to a campsite and see someone else before you throw trash everywhere, you should try to clean some of it up and not say "that's not my job"

**Do**
- Tidy small issues you encounter in passing (naming, typos, low-risk refactors).
- Fix obvious lints and add missing tests near the change you’re making.
- Add a brief note in your PR describing opportunistic cleanups.

**Don’t**
- Sneak in large, unrelated refactors under a feature/change.
- Change public APIs or folder structure “just because.”
- Leave obvious messes (“not my code”) for the next person.

Be careful of scope though. You don't want your PR being too large. This is where you should make a seperate PR for fixing the issues, but you need to clearly comment that intent _and_ follow through on it.
