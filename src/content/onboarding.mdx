# Onboarding

This is a living document. If you are a newcomer and any of these directions need to be updated or you need to add to it, please do so by creating a PR to this page.

## Resources

### Repositories
- **Org:** [PeerRated](https://github.com/PeerRated)
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/PeerRated/Documentation)

## Local Setup

This should be documented in each of the respective README.md of each repository. If it is not or it is up to date, that is a good first PR task for you to update with the steps needed in the respective repository.

After this step, you should be able to:
1) Have the necessary repositories cloned
2) Build the application(s) youâ€™ll work on
3) Run and test locally

## Next Steps 
- Read [team development standards](/standards) page
