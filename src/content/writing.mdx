# How to Update These Docs

This page shows **where** to make changes, **how** to propose them, and **exact MDX snippets** you can copy

## Where to Edit
- Docs live under this repo’s **content** folder
- Most shared assets (images, logos, memes) go in **/public/images/** and are referenced by path

## How to Propose Changes
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b docs/<short-slug>`
2. Edit or add `.mdx` files (use the snippets below)
3. Run locally and verify: `pnpm run dev`
4. Open a PR using the **PR template**

## Style Rules
- Link to deeper pages; avoid duplicating content
- Put images in `/public/images/...`
- Start every page with front-matter
- Keep filenames kebab-case: `how-to-update.mdx`
